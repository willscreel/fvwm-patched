  * More changes to the Debian menu handling in the configuration file.
  * [0e04470]: [fvwm]: Add a menuentry to refresh the Debian menu
    If a user installs new packages, the system menudefs.hook file
    defining the Debian menu changes. So far, there was no easy way to
    refresh the menus for a running fvwm instance. This patch adds a
    couple of entries into the Root menu to re-read the system
    menudefs.hook file, or to (re)create and re-read a users local
    menudefs.hook file using the Debian command updatge-menus. This allows
    the menu definitions to be refreshed, providing the functionality of
    the old fvwm-update-menus script, but using Fvwm commands.
    Bug fix: "provide some version of fvwm-update-menus", thanks to Julian
    Gilbey                                                   (Closes: #246902).

    from the system. The user may re-read the system menu file, or
    re-create and re-read a personal copy created by update-menus.

    request_query method
  * [6b72394]: [topic--debian-menu]: No unconditionally load of Debian menu
    Also, we used to expand the ImagePath unconditionally as well. Now
    the sample configuration files read the menu definitions and expand
    the imagepath only when there is a menu definition file to read, and
    users can opt out of that behaviour.
  * [fd4e000]: [topic--debian-menu]: Add Debian menu to all sample files
    Debian technical policy states that all window manager should provide
    access to the Debian menus. We have been patching the window manager
    to read the menus and set the iamge path willy-nilly, but this
    prevented users from optiong out of loading the menus, and from
    expanding the Image paths. Also, upstream were unhappy about the code
    divergence. So, this is the first part of removing the divergence and
    instead using configuration files to ensure that the Debian menu
    heirarchy is available.
  * [58b579f]: [debiandir:fvwm]: Add a system.fvwm2rc file back
    After 5 years, Debian reintroduces the default system configuration
    file for fvwm, system.fvwm2rc, back to the distribution. But instead
    of the old, ugly, mostly low usability default configuratgion, this
    configuration file is derived from a flattened theme from fvwm-
    themes, and uses most of the modern conventions of new fvwm
    (colorsets, etc). The new system.fvwm2rc file also suports teh Debian
    menusystem, and can serve as a decent starting point for modification
    -- and should easily be converted into a fvwm theme again.

fvwm (1:2.5.27.ds-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: "fvwm fails to find certain icon files, ImagePath directive
    seems broken.", thanks to Andreas Hartmann. The actual issue was more
    complex than that. The problem was, that in order to satisfy the
    policy directive that the Debian menu was available, fvwm always reads
    the menu defs -- too early for any ImagePath directives in the config
    file. There was no loss in functionality, since when the config file
    was read, the ImagePath was set,and then when the menu definitions
    were read the second time, the menu was setup correctly -- though the
    first reading emitted the scary warnings.   The solution was to set a
    default ImagePath that caters to the paths used in Debian packages,
    thus doing away with scary warnings.                  (Closes: #449248).

  * [debiandirb8a6619]: Rearrange dependencies
    There is nothing in fvwm that needs ncurses directly, so that
    dependency can go. However, libx11-protocol-perl and perl-tk are
    needed for FvwmTabs to work -- this is a module shipped with FVWM.
  * [97b77ad]: Merge branch 'topic--debian'
  * [9386fab]: Add missing "%" characters after menu icons
    This caused the icons not to appear in the menus.
  * [b79d425]: /etc/X11/fvwm/DebianMenu has been renamed
    Update Script95 to match the renamed name of the autogenerated file.
  * [f3d3578]: Fix a typo; StayOnTop -> StaysOnTop
    With this change, and the two recent one, we have handled the major
    issues with Script95                             Closes: Bug#501358

fvwm (1:2.5.27.ds-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
     - New extended variable
       $[w.visiblename]
     - Style matching now honours the window's visible name which
       means it can be matched before the real name, hence:
         Style $[w.visiblename] Colorset 5
        is now honoured.  Useful with IndexedWindowName as a style
        option.
    - New style InitialMapCommand allows to execute any command
      when a window is mapped first.
    - New option to PrintInfo, "bindings" which prints out all of
      the Key, PointerKey, Mouse and Stroke bindings which fvwm
      knows about.
    - Fixed compilation without XRender support.
    - Fixed handling of _NET_MOVERESIZE_WINDOWS requests.
    - Fixed a bug in automatic detection mode of the style
      MoveByProgramMethod.
    - Fixed png detection when cross compiling.
    - Fixed keeping fullscreen window mode over a restart.
    - The style PositionPlacement now honours StartsOnPage.
    - Reset signal handlers for executed modules and programs.
    - Try to handle a bug an old version of the EWMH spec by
      honouring both, the _NET_WM_STATE_MAXIMIZED_HORIZ hint and
      the _NET_WM_STATE_MAXIMIZED_HORZ hitn.
    - Fix the GNOME location prefix to application .desktop files.
    - 'PositionPlacement UnderMouse' now forces the window
      on-screen, just like the old UnderMousePlacement style option
      used to.

fvwm (1:2.5.26-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * [debiandir:250b152]: Update the standards version, as well as the VCS
    browser field
  * [debiandir:e2d7ea6]: Remove the gtk build dependencies, and do not
    look for gtk The menus used in Fvwm can either be native, or, using
    FvwmGTK, be GTK-based alternatives. FvwmGtk only has options to define
    the content of the menus and dialogs. The builtin menus offer many
    features which the GTK menus currently don’t have. None of the
    features of the builtin window-list have been implemented. FvwmGtk
    module requires GTK+ and optionally GDK-Imlib and GNOME libraries.
    GDK-Imlib library that is a part of Imlib version 1 is used to have
    images. Most of thee libraries are not obsolete, and development of
    FvwmGtk module does not seem to be keeping up. Note, fvwm itself has
    an ability to support GNOME Window Manager hints (which is enabled by
    default), this has nothing to do with GNOME library support compiled
    into FvwmGtk (which is autoprobed and used if passed). In this commit,
    we disable autoprobing of GTK+, Imlib and GNOME libraries. This is a
    imperceptible change in functionality.

     unless the style Unmanaged was used.                     (Closes: #443573)
   - Edge move delay was used as resistance for the top edge. (Closes: #465454)
   - Fixed a parsing problem of the screen argument of the
     SnapAttraction style.
   - Some html documentation files were not installed.
   - Fixed a memory leak in internationalized font handling.

   - Fixed a possible crash if the last active module fails.
  * Bug fix: "fvwm: should not conflict against fvwm-gnome", thanks to
    Philipp Kern. Yes, there should have been a versioned conflicts, I
    think.                                                     (Closes: #470149)

fvwm (1:2.5.24-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
   - Disabled paging during interactive resize operations by
     default (see 2.5.20) as it is annoying to many people.
   - New style command options:
       EdgeMoveResistance
       EdgeMoveDelay
       EdgeResizeDelay
       SnapGrid
       SnapAttraction
     that replace the now obsolete commands EdgeResistance,
     SnapGrid and SnapAttraction.  The EdgeResistance command has
     a new syntax with only one argument.
   - New command MenuCloseAndExec for menu bindinngs that can be
     used to trigger certain commands from a menu without an
     associated item.  For example, with
       Key F1 MTI[]-_ A MenuCloseAndExec Menu RootMenu
     the RootMenu can be opened from any other menu by pressing
     F1.
  * Bug fixes:
   - Sometimes a window jumped by half the screen's size when
     moving with the mouse and hitting the border of the desktop.
   - Fixed the "screen w" argument of the Move and other commands.
   - Clicking on a menu title did not close the menu by default.
   - Temporary files in FvwmPerl overwrote each other.
  * The segmentation fault in ewmh_events has been fixed in this
    version.                                   (Closes: #463384)
  * Change the dependency to gnome1 libraries; (Closes: #460761)
    This also means that there was no point in having a separate fvwm
    package where FvwmGtk was a gnome entity; since it was never ported to
    gnome2. So, fvwm-gnome is now a dummy package; and is meant to
    transition to plain old fvwm.
  * Removed the debconf question; since the upgrade would be directly from
    a system installed in 2003 for the question to be valid.
  * Move _all the html files into the documentation directory, thanks to
    Christer Andersson.                        (Closes: #455473)

    am also not in favour of modifying things on disk during clean --
    clean returns the directory to the state it was in before. So, this is

    contain ./configure, it was created by the diff.gz -- and that leaves

    requirement to install the large chunks of GNOME, a new package,
    fvwm-gnome, has been created, and fvwm proper shall not depend on
    gnome.                                               (Closes: #256136).

    smooth enough, though not automated, since this radical a change can't
    easily be automated, and the old configuration is horribly out of
    date anyway.                                         (Closes: #247599).

    mistake (Closes: #48756)

 -- Julian Gilbey <jdg@debian.org>  Sun, 31 Oct 1999 23:23:48 +0000

  * Changed "Exec" to "Exec exec" in menu-method file (Closes: #47291)

fvwm (2.2.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Another new upstream bug-fix release

 -- Julian Gilbey <jdg@debian.org>  Mon,  7 Jun 1999 16:25:34 +0100

fvwm (2.2.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Never released (not checked for compilability etc)

 -- Julian Gilbey <jdg@debian.org>  Fri, 14 May 1999 02:13:12 +0100

fvwm (2.2-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Hopefully last release of 2.2 before moving to 2.2.1 (a bug-fix
    release)
  * Add a new hook to system.fvwm2rc called default-style.hook, so that
    all of the icon settings and suchlike don't need to be reset
  * Modified system.warnings to provide a restart option on the quit form
  * Added example: default-style-hook.change-colours to show how to do so
  * Added example: post-hook.change-buttons to reproduce the behaviour of
    2.2-3's title bar buttons
  * Added example: post-hook.window-buttons-maximize
  * Added example: post-hook.menu-form-exit to use QuitVerify
  * Moved default xterm in system.fvwm2rc to top of menu (suggested by
    Andrew Pimlott)
  * Only have default xterm in main menu if the menu package is not
    present (by destroying the menu and re-reading the hook files in the
    menu-method)
  * Correct icon commands in system.fvwm2rc to refer to programs by
    resource class rather than title
  * Setup-background has new config file location again and once more can
    use sitewide config files (although in a new location); Closes: #35634
    again!
  * Have postinst for fvwm-common move setup-background's global config
    files from /etc/X11/fvwm2 (or their rescued location) to their new
    location

 -- Julian Gilbey <jdg@debian.org>  Fri, 14 May 1999 00:35:29 +0100

fvwm (2.2-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Undo the change to system.fvwm2rc introduced by the fix to #37082 in
    2.2-4.  This turned out to make everything far, far too slow.  The
    code has been relegated to a post.hook example file for those who want
    it and are prepared to pay the performance penalty.  The problem can
    also be `solved' by removing NumLock and ScrollLock's xmodmap
    bindings.

 -- Julian Gilbey <jdg@debian.org>  Tue,  4 May 1999 04:35:52 +0100

fvwm (2.2-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add MiniIcon style options to system.fvwm2rc for common programs;
    although these will probably need changing when wm-icons is
    introduced (Closes: #11355)
  * Always have an xterm option on the Debian menu, even if the menu
    package is not installed (so won't be stuck with nothing)
  * Correction to fvwmrc_convert Sticky* problem
  * Wrote setup-background manpage, further alleviating #35634; I think it
    can probably be closed soon, once the READMEs are improved; #35706 can
    be closed as well
  * Correct menu-method (Closes: #35829, #36500)
  * system.fvwm2rc changes:
    - Corrected syntax of Exec commands (to avoid extra shell processes)
    - Returned to Exit fvwm menu instead of form (Closes: #36232)
    - Added MiniIcon options to the Style commands (Closes: #11355)
    - Adds Alt-Fn to the Window-Ops menu (Closes: #32923).  I don't really
      like the order of options: they make little sense, but the principle
      of least surprise requires me to maintain them.  I hope to add an
      example post.hook in the examples directory to handle this
    - Reverted back to Lars' colour scheme (white/steelblue) to please
      Branden ;-) (Closes: #36231)
    - Removed the excess window buttons as well (Closes: #36234)
    - Handle NumLock and/or ScrollLock being on (Closes: #37082)
  * Added some example hook files in /usr/doc/fvwm/examples
  * Now only Suggests: menu rather than Recommends: (Closes: #36335)
  * Modify preinst so it only saves modified .hook files (as compared with
    the Debian 2.1 (slink) version), saves the whole old /etc/X11/fvwm2
    directory structure too, and only asks the user to hit return to read
    the message. This will hopefully be dealt with better at a later
    stage. Also rewrote preinst in Perl for the purpose.
  * Revert to only Recommending fvwm-common rather than Depending
  * Removed fvwm-common-beta conflict, as there won't exist such a
    package
  * Added support for readline and rplay

 -- Julian Gilbey <jdg@debian.org>  Mon,  3 May 1999 23:50:04 +0100

fvwm (2.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made fvwm Depend on fvwm-common because of setup-background being
    called from system.fvwm2rc. Currently an ugly hack, which will
    hopefully be cured soon, with fvwm-common being split into wm-common
    and wm-icons
  * fvwm-common now suggests xloadimage. (Closes: #35707)
  * setup-background is now window-manager-independent. However, this
    means that its config files have moved. This is documented in the
    README file, and will be documented in the manpage to appear
    (hopefully) in the next upload -- sort of exacerbates bug #35634
  * fixed debian/rules to handle broken fileutils 4.0 (Closes: #35866);
    thanks James for spotting this one!

 -- Julian Gilbey <jdg@debian.org>  Wed, 14 Apr 1999 22:29:40 +0100

fvwm (2.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Corrected semantic error in preinst. (Closes: #34981)

fvwm (2.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream (stable!!) source; this is the first stable release of
    FVWM 2
  * New maintainer
  * MAJOR USER-VISIBLE CHANGES have been made in this package as compared
    to the fvwm2 beta-releases.  These are mainly due to the fact that
    fvwm is now the main package and fvwm1 is secondary: please see the
    README.upgrade file for details
  * Renamed this package as fvwm on Branden Robinson's advice, as it is
    now *the* stable fvwm; FVWM 1.xx has been discontinued upstream (and
    FVWM 1.xx is now found in the fvwm1 package)
  * Massive changes to the Debian scripts which solve several of the
    Debian-related bugs
  * Lots of bugs are closed by fixes in the upstream source since the bugs
    were filed
  * This release closes many bugs: (Closes: #5736, #10862, #11861, #16143, #18576, #20444,
    #20831, #22286, #24135, #32796, #32939, #33109, #33755, #34149,
    #18003, #21097, #32795, #8785, #8954, #14791, 21547, #25601, #11495,
    #27276); although some of these are not really fixed, but the upstream
    authors do not intend to do so in the near future. Also, the
    following bugs are partially fixed: 11824 and 11886.

fvwm2 (2.1.10-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (Closes: #31800, #30418, #25943)
    (Upstream version changed a _lot_ of code, so I had to
    shoehorn the previous changes; Hope I got it right.)
  * changes to debian/rules:
    - adapt for GNU configure.
    - Fvwm.tmpl doesn't exist anymore.
    - strip executables (Pkg size: 2.4Mo -> 700k)

  * extras/* modules included (Closes: #8665, #16949).
  * Removed Recommends: from package fvwm-common on fvwm2|fvwm95:

    which are using it to recommend fvwm-common.
    (Closes: #26671)
  * Move setup-background from fvwm2 to fvwm-common (Bug #21314).
  * Patch setup-background so it works with other window managers

    to consider 10099 fixed. (Closes: #10099)
  * #10862 has been fixed in upstream code.
  * Don't autoconvert the users' .fvwmrc anymore.
    (Closes: #11899, #25939, #26316, #30506)
  * Close #13008 & #12985: This was very likely due to a file
    corruption that happened during download, or the file was already
    corrupted/truncated on the mirror were it has been fetched.
  * Close #13146: This is not a bug, but the expected behavior.
  * Close #14236: The behavior has changed upstream.
  * s/DestroyMenu/DestroyFunc/ in system.fvwm2rc
    (Closes: #17667, #24310).
  * Set 'Mouse 0 W M -' in system.fvwm2rc (Closes: #17668).
  * Fix #22844 (NMU Hack). Could not re-apply the patch since
    the build system has moved to autoconf.
  * s/README.sysrc/README.sysrc.gz/ in system.fvwm2rc
    (Closes: #22982).
  * The fvwm2-plus package isn't produced anymore. (Closes: #25770, #25941, #25942)
  * Set PagerGeometry to '-0-0'. (Closes: #27851)
  * Now built with rplay support. (Closes: #31439)
  * Don't Recommends: menu, just Suggests: it. (Closes: #17972)
  * Add Y. Dirson's suggestion to system.fvwm2rc. (Closes: #26748)
  * post{inst,rm} scripts now use the register-window-manager
    script.
